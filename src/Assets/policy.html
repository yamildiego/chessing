        <strong>7. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="body_text">
        Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile applications
        include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you can activate to
        signal your privacy preference not to have data about your online browsing
        activities monitored and collected. At this stage no uniform technology
        standard for recognizing and implementing DNT signals has been finalized.
        As such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other
        mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked
        online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in
        the future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version of
        this privacy notice.
